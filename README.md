# Resource Loader [Fabric]

Loads resources; a useful mod pack utility

## How to Use

The `resources` folder in the game directory acts as a resource pack. You can do anything with it, such as change the description or add an icon to represent your mod pack. This pack cannot be disabled in the menu.

This mod is not intended to replace the functionality of the default resource pack loader. For users, if you want a resource pack, put it in the `resourcepacks` folder.

This mod also doesn't allow for data pack loading; for that, use [Cotton](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cotton).

This mod is not compatible with Forge, use [Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).

Fabric API is not necessary.
